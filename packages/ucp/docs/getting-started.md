This tutorial is about how to install and use the [@solidlab/ucp](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/user-managed-access/tree/main/packages/ucp) library utilities.

## Installing

As of today (2 Februari 2024), this package is not on npm.
Which means installing via `npm install @solidlab/ucp` does **not** work yet.

However, it can still easily installed by adding `"@solidlab/ucp": "https://gitpkg.now.sh/SolidLabResearch/user-managed-access/packages/css?main"` to your dependencies in package.json, or executing the corresponding command of your favourite package manager, e.g. `yarn add @solidlab/ucp@"https://gitpkg.now.sh/SolidLabResearch/user-managed-access/packages/css?main"`.

## Using the library

First, a brief reminder of what the goal is of this library.
What this library gives is a set of tools for creating **usage control decision** engines that are fully customizable.
A **usage control decision** engine evaluates an *action request* against a set of *Usage Control Policies* to get a conclusion of *access grants*.

### Example

As an example, imagine that Ruben wants to know Wout his age.
The age of Wout can be found in a *resource*, `urn:wout:age` (a unique identifier), and is safeguarded by Wout his *policy* that says Ruben has read access to the *resource*. 
oncretely, this policy could be modelled as a tuple (Requesting Party (RP), action, target resource, resource owner), which in this example would be (`urn:ruben`, `urn:modes:read`, `urn:wout:age`, `urn:wout`).
The **usage control decision** engine, would then be able to interpret both the request and the policy to give as conclusion a grant: `urn:modes:read`. 
This means Ruben is able to know Wout his age and we know that the access is allowed conforming to the policies of Wout thanks to the engine.

Note: that this example does not contain any usage control yet, but is rather access control.
When a policy has additional to the current tuple expression and enforcement for e.g. Ruben has to delete the data after 30 days and/or that he can only use it for the purpose of for example buying a gift for Wout his Birthday, then we are talking about Usage Control.
Though, you could see the current use case as preventive usage control without purposes.

### High level Architecture

There are two functions implemented to calculate the grants, both are part of the interface `UconEnforcementDecision`.

1. `calculateAccessModes`: Calculate the *access grants* based on the set of *Usage Control Policies* , the *request* and how to *interpret the policies* (the algorithm).
2. `calculateAndExplainAccessModes`: The same as `calculateAccessModes`, but also provides an **Explanation** of how the *access grants* are calculated.

Both functions have as input a `UconRequest`. This is an interface that formalizes the action request e.g. (RP, requested action, resource) (`urn:ruben`, `urn:modes:read`, `urn:wout:age`).

As output, `calculateAccessModes` has a list of strings (*access grants*) and `calculateAndExplainAccessModes` has an `Explanation` (which will be elaborated later).

### The first usage control decision engine

The implementation of the `UconEnforcementDecision` interface that this library provides is `UcpPatternEnforcement`.

The first instantiation of this interface is what is referred here as the first **usage control decision** engine.
Before this instantiation is given, an explanation of how it works is given in [the following section](#usage-control-decision-engine).

#### Usage Control Decision engine

The (`UcpPatternEnforcement`) engine has three components and can be consulted with the methods described in [the high level architecture](#high-level-architecture).

The three components:

- A **[storage](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/user-managed-access/tree/main/packages/ucp/src/plugins)** to the set of *Usage Control Policies*
- A **storage** to the set of [Notation3](https://w3c.github.io/N3/spec/) (N3) [interpretation rules](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/user-managed-access/tree/main/packages/ucp/rules)
- A configured instance of **[Koreografeye](https://github.com/eyereasoner/Koreografeye)** consisting of:
  - An **N3 reasoner** ([eye-js](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye-js))
  - A [Koreografeye policy/plugin executor](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/user-managed-access/blob/main/packages/ucp/src/PolicyExecutor.ts) + [plugins](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/user-managed-access/tree/main/packages/ucp/src/plugins)

When a method (e.g. `calculateAccessModes`) is then called with an *action request* the following steps are then executed:

1. The N3 Reasoner runs with as input:
   1. The set of *Usage Control Policies*
   2. The request (`UconRequest` serialized as RDF)
   3. The N3 *interpretation rules*
2. The conclusion from the Reasoner is then extracted by the Koreografeye policy/plugin executor (configured with plugins)
3. The result is then returned

This modular approach allows for fast prototyping of a formal Usage Control Policy language, which can then immediately be evaluated.

#### Instantiation

This first policy engine instantiation can perform an evaluation of policies modelled with [Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/).
More specifically, with a subset that only can interpret `odrl:Permission`s with as **action** `odrl:modify`, `odrl:read` and `odrl:use` (which means both modify and read) against action requests and where there are **no Constraints**.

To initialise `UcpPatternEnforcement` as this engine, the following code is required:
https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/user-managed-access/blob/1c0410b6f1c3f133843430f60d4f8c690273dff0/packages/ucp/docs/simple-engine.ts#L1-L18


At this point, the engine is ready to be used. Which means that now you can use the `calculateAccessModes` function to request the **grants** for following *action request*: "Ruben wants to know the age of Wout".

https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/user-managed-access/blob/1c0410b6f1c3f133843430f60d4f8c690273dff0/packages/ucp/docs/simple-engine.ts#L20-L27

Unfortunately, this results into an empty list `[]`. Which means no **grants** are given and thus Ruben cannot know the age of Wout.

The reason for this is very simple, there is **no** *Usage Control Policy* in the storage.

This can however be resolved by simply adding such a policy to the **Usage Control Rule Storage**:

```ttl
@prefix odrl: <http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/> .
@prefix : <http://example.org/usageControlRule> .

:permission
  a odrl:Permission ;
  odrl:action odrl:read ;
  odrl:target <urn:wout:age> ;
  odrl:assignee <https://pod.rubendedecker.be/profile/card#me> ;
  odrl:assigner <https://pod.woutslabbinck.com/profile/card#me> .
```

To add this rule to the storage, the following code can be used:

https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/user-managed-access/blob/1c0410b6f1c3f133843430f60d4f8c690273dff0/packages/ucp/docs/simple-engine.ts#L30-L41


From now on, when the access modes are calculated again, the following list of grants is received:

```sh
[ 'http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#Read' ]
```

With current initialisation of the **UC Decision engine**, grants are modelled with the [Access Control List (ACL)](https://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl) Ontology.
The reason for this is that this component is going to be used in an Authorisation Server (AS) for a [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) Resource Server (RS) using the [User-Managed Access (UMA)](https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-grant-2.0.html) specification. In the [Solid Protocol](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol), ACL is the ontology used for **access modes** both its authorization specifications: the [Web Access Control (WAC)](https://solidproject.org/TR/wac) specification and the [Access Control Policy (ACP)](https://solidproject.org/TR/acp) specification.

In the engine, this grant is calculated within the N3 interpretation rules, more specifically [here](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/user-managed-access/blob/949917faa015195369e430f77200bf3273f79283/packages/ucp/rules/data-crud-rules.n3#L12-L38).

The full code sample for this example can be found in [appendix I](#appendix-I-Full-code-snippet)

### Temporal Policy engine

TODO:

### Engine with explanation

First an elaboration is given for what is meant by explanation.
<!--Note: after implementation, similarities have been found with the idea of **ODRL Evaluator** from the [ODRL Formal Semantics Community Group](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/formal-semantics/).-->

#### Explanation

So what is the explanation exactly? It is an interface which contains four components:


An `Explanation` consists of four components:

- `decision`: This is the same as the grants (array of access modes) from `calculateAccessModes`. It is the **result** of the evaluation
- `request`: The input *action request* 
- `conclusions`: The conclusions of the reasoner. A conclusion itself consists of four parts: the **Rule Identifier**, the **Interpration N3 Rule Identifier**, the **grants** allowed (the actual conclusion) and the **timestamp** at which the conclusion was generated. A conclusion can be seen as the proof of following function: $interpretation(rule, context, timestamp) -> grants$
- `algorithm`: Which algorithm is used to interpret the set of conclusions
  - Note: only the **union** operator is currently implemented. That is: $\forall c \in C. grant \in c \Rightarrow grant \in D$ </br>
    For all conclusions in `conclusions`, if a grant is in conclusion, then it is part of the list of grants in `decision`.

Having the **Explanation** after an evaluation thus allows for logging with provenance/proof of why a certain action was granted at a certain time.

#### Instantiation

To have a **usage control decision** engine that can give **Explanations**, it needs to be instantiated correctly. This can be done with following code:

https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/user-managed-access/blob/1c0410b6f1c3f133843430f60d4f8c690273dff0/packages/ucp/docs/log-engine.ts#L1-L18

Note that compared to the previous engines, a different **plugin** and a different **N3 interpretation rules** are used.
These allow for retrieving a proper explanation during the calculation of the requests.

Another difference is the fact that know the method `calculateAndExplainAccessModes` has to be used. 
Luckily, this still uses a `UconRequest` as input:

https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/user-managed-access/blob/1c0410b6f1c3f133843430f60d4f8c690273dff0/packages/ucp/docs/log-engine.ts#L34-L41
When a policy is added to the storage, the above code print out a Javascript Object, which is not very nice.

Luckily, it is possible to have a nice RDF serialization as output:

https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/user-managed-access/blob/1c0410b6f1c3f133843430f60d4f8c690273dff0/packages/ucp/docs/log-engine.ts#L46-L49

Or to be used as RDF in code with the N3 Store: 

https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/user-managed-access/blob/1c0410b6f1c3f133843430f60d4f8c690273dff0/packages/ucp/docs/log-engine.ts#L43-L44
